        <p>This is a test to research how quickly indicators of compromise (IOC) propagate between different blocklists. The approach is 
            <ul>
                <li>Register a fresh domain;
                <li>Add it one known block list, for example <a href="https://www.botvrij.eu">botvrij.eu</a>;</li>
                <li>Query other blocklists, via URLHaus, VT and MISP and check if the domain is included or not;</li>
                <li>Build a timeline.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
